You are designing UI for a SaaS product called “SuperAgent”, an AI-powered real estate assistant.

GLOBAL DESIGN CONCEPT
Name: Calm Intelligence UI

This product must feel:
•⁠ ⁠Calm
•⁠ ⁠Confident
•⁠ ⁠Reassuring
•⁠ ⁠Minimal
•⁠ ⁠Effortless

This is NOT a busy CRM, analytics tool, or chat interface.
This is a control room where AI thinks first and the user only confirms decisions.

CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1.⁠ ⁠One dominant action per screen

- Never present multiple primary CTAs competing for attention
- Secondary actions must be visually subordinate

  2.⁠ ⁠AI-first hierarchy

- AI suggestions always appear before manual controls
- The system proposes, the user approves
- Avoid forms unless absolutely required

  3.⁠ ⁠White space is functional

- Space is used to reduce cognitive load, not fill the screen
- Large margins and generous padding are expected
- Empty space is a feature, not a bug

  4.⁠ ⁠Calm over efficiency

- Slightly slower, smoother interactions are preferred
- Never rush the user visually
- Avoid dense tables, heavy grids, or information overload

  5.⁠ ⁠Vertical rhythm over horizontal density

- Content should flow vertically
- Avoid wide tables and crowded layouts
- Prefer cards, steps, and timelines

LAYOUT & STRUCTURE RULES
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

•⁠ ⁠Desktop-first (1440px), responsive down to mobile
•⁠ ⁠Max content width: 1200px, centered
•⁠ ⁠Large outer margins (≥96px on desktop)
•⁠ ⁠Section spacing: 64px between major sections
•⁠ ⁠Card spacing: 24px
•⁠ ⁠Card padding: 24–32px
•⁠ ⁠Use simple column structures (1, 2, or 3 columns max)

Admin pages MUST follow the same spacing and calm visual rhythm.
Admin ≠ dense or technical.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
COLOR & DEPTH
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

•⁠ ⁠Backgrounds: white or very light gray
•⁠ ⁠Cards: pure white
•⁠ ⁠Depth created with soft shadows, not borders
•⁠ ⁠Rounded corners (14–16px)
•⁠ ⁠One subtle accent color only
•⁠ ⁠Avoid strong contrast or aggressive colors
•⁠ ⁠Error states should be calm, not alarming

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
TYPOGRAPHY
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

•⁠ ⁠Editorial, readable typography
•⁠ ⁠Max 3 font sizes visible per screen
•⁠ ⁠Comfortable line height (≥1.4)
•⁠ ⁠Avoid condensed or decorative fonts
•⁠ ⁠Text should feel written, not “system-generated”

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
MOTION & INTERACTION
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Motion philosophy:
Motion explains state, not decoration.

Rules:
•⁠ ⁠No bounce animations
•⁠ ⁠No playful easing
•⁠ ⁠No scale-on-hover effects
•⁠ ⁠No spinners for AI thinking

Preferred motion:
•⁠ ⁠Fade + small vertical movement (≤8px)
•⁠ ⁠Soft easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
•⁠ ⁠Subtle stagger for lists (40ms)

AI states:
•⁠ ⁠Use calm “thinking” text instead of spinners
•⁠ ⁠AI suggestions appear smoothly (fade + slight slide)
•⁠ ⁠Text transitions word-by-word, not letter-by-letter

Hover & focus:
•⁠ ⁠Use elevation and shadow changes only
•⁠ ⁠Focus states must be visible but subtle

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
CONTENT & COPY
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

•⁠ ⁠Language should be calm, professional, and reassuring
•⁠ ⁠Avoid technical jargon when possible
•⁠ ⁠Avoid exclamation points
•⁠ ⁠The UI should feel like a competent assistant, not a chatbot

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
WHAT TO AVOID (IMPORTANT)
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

•⁠ ⁠No kanban boards
•⁠ ⁠No dense tables by default
•⁠ ⁠No multi-CTA hero sections
•⁠ ⁠No noisy dashboards
•⁠ ⁠No “AI magic” visuals or robot imagery
•⁠ ⁠No chat-first interfaces

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
SUCCESS CRITERIA
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Every screen should make the user feel:
“I am in control, and the system has already done the hard thinking for me.”

If a design increases cognitive load or visual stress, it is wrong.
