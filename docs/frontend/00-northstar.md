# SuperAgent Frontend North Star

**Concept:** Calm Intelligence UI  
**Product:** SuperAgent — AI-powered real estate assistant

## Purpose

SuperAgent is a calm control room for real estate workflows. The AI proposes next best actions; the user confirms. The UI reduces stress and cognitive load.

## What this product is

- A guided workflow interface (steps, decisions, progress)
- A reassurance layer ("you're on track")
- An AI-first assistant that suggests, explains, and unblocks

## What this product is NOT

- A busy CRM with dense dashboards
- A chat-first interface
- An analytics tool
- An admin console that feels technical and cluttered

## Emotional goals

Users should feel:

- "I'm not behind."
- "The system understands my work."
- "I can't mess this up."

If the UI feels efficient but stressful, it failed.

## Non-negotiable principles

1. **One dominant action per screen**
   - At any moment there is ONE obvious primary CTA.
   - Secondary actions are visually subordinate or in an overflow menu.

2. **AI-first hierarchy**
   - The AI suggestion (what to do next) appears before manual controls.
   - The system proposes → the user approves.

3. **White space is functional**
   - Empty space is a design feature to reduce cognitive load.
   - Avoid "filling" screens with widgets.

4. **Vertical rhythm over horizontal density**
   - Prefer cards, steps, timelines, drawers.
   - Avoid wide, dense tables and multi-row toolbars.

5. **Calm motion**
   - Motion explains state, never decoration.
   - No bounce. No scale-on-hover. No spinners for AI thinking.

## Content & tone

- Calm, professional, concise.
- No exclamation points.
- Avoid marketing language ("revolutionary", "unlock", "leverage", "utilize").
- AI copy should feel deliberate and human.

## Design review success criteria

Every screen should communicate:

> "I am in control, and the system already did the hard thinking."
